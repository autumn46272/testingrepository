HOW TO UPLOAD THIS PROJECT TO A SEPARATE REPOSITORY

If you give this project folder to someone else and they want to upload it to their own GitHub repository, follow these steps:

1. Prerequisite: Install Git
   - Download from: https://git-scm.com/downloads
   - Install with default settings.
   - Typically installed at: C:\Program Files\Git\cmd\git.exe

2. Open Terminal in Project Folder
   - Right-click the folder > "Open in Terminal" or use Command Prompt.

3. Remove the Old Repository Link
   Type this command and press Enter:
   git remote remove origin

4. Create a New Repository on GitHub
   - Go to github.com and create a new empty repository.
   - Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO-NAME.git).

5. Link to the New Repository
   Type this command (replace with your URL):
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-NEW-REPO.git

6. Upload the Code
   Type this command:
   git push -u origin main
